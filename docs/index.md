# Welcome to RWBY Adventures

!!! info
    The documentation is currently being written, some things might be missing.

RWBY Adventures is an [open-source](https://github.com/yyewolf/rwbyadv3) Discord bot.
It is the third version of its kind and aims for stability, ease of use and better code practices.

What sets RWBY Adventures apart is the set of features offered to the players.
Some minigames are played on a website instead of Discord.

Developing RWBY Adventures, my main goal is to make it effortless to use.
